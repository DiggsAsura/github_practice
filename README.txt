Running through the Codecademy Git and GitHub course, to get a bit deeper into this
than only using GitHub as a "dropbox" lol. 

My contributions will be fake high for a couple of days (eta feb 21 - feb 25), as I
keep pushing text files to this repo. 

Nothing much to see really, just me getting into the habits.

Cheers,
K
