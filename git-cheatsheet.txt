Basic Git Workflow
1. Basic Git Workflow

git init        	   	  			(created a new Git reposityroy)
git status   									(inspects the contents of the working direcotry and the 
															 staging area)
git add filename1 filename2		(adds files from the working directory to the staging area)
git diff   						  			(shows the difference between the working directory and the 
															 staging area)
git commit -m "message" 	  	(permanently stores file changes from the staging area in 
															 the repository. remember, message is important!)
git log   								  	(shows a list of all previous commits)
git show HEAD               	(shows in green what's last added to the commit)
git checkout HEAD filename  	(Discards changes in the working directory. To get files 
															 in the current workplace synced up with the head)
git reset HEAD filename     	(Unstages file changes in the staging area.)
git reset commit_SHA					(This command works by using the first 7 characters of 
															 the SHA of a previous commit. Fox example, if the SHA
															 of the previous commit is 				
															 5d692065cf51a2f50ea8e7b19b5a7ae512f633ba,
															 use git reset 5d69206)
git stash                  	 ("Freeze" the current work directory, without commiting?)
git stash pop									("Get back to your stashed code")
git commit --amend          	("Update without making a new commit)
git commit --amend --no-edit  (Same as above, but with no new message)

git push -u origin master       (push to GitHub)
git push origin your_branch_name

Also note Aliases
$ git config --global alias.co "checkout"
$ git config --global alias.br "branch"
$ git config --global alias.glop "log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph"

Once the aliases are configured, next time you want to check out to another branch you could type the command:
$ git co example_branch
instead of
$ git checkout example_branch



git branch										(check which branch i'm currently on)
git branch new_branch         (create a new branch out of the current im on)
git checkout branch_name			(switch to the other branch)
git merge branch_name					(merge the branches)
git branch -d branch_name 		(delete branch, which you always should do after merge)
git branch -D branch_name     (delete un-merged branches)


git clone remote_location clone_name
git remote -v									(See list of Git project's remotes)
git fetch											(get updated file from projets origin/remote)

Note, after fetch, even though we grabbed updates -it have not overwritten anything
in our own working directory. 
git merge origin/main to push changes into local directory


How to Use Git Rebase
========================

git rebase                     (an option to merge. say quick_fix happens during new_feature, where quick_fix is merged back to main branch before new_feature is ready????)

Git rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another base branch.
Git merge: joins two or more development histories together (creating a new merge commit).

Merge can end up in messy commit log, while rebase reconstucts it and keeps it linear.

Generally, it’s useful to use merge whenever we want to add changes of a branch back into the base branch. And rebase is useful whenever we want to add changes of a base branch back to a branched out branch. 

Git rebase can be a very powerful tool when working with numerous people and branches, if used correctly it allows everyone to view a very clean commit history and track what commits fixed given defects or whether or not a commit was included in a release. However, it’s critical to understand how it works and the risks that come with it since it’s a destructive operation. If done so correctly, it can result in a very fluid and effective workflow.
