Git/GitHub TEAM workflow:

1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you
	 were working)
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review. 		

Steps 1 and 4 are asafeguard against merge conflicts, which occur when two 
branches contain file changes that cannot be merged with the git merge command.
Step 5 involves git push, a command you will learn in the next exercise.
