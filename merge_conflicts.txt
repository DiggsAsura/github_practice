Merge conflicts

If trying to merge two branches which both have changed the same lines:

Git uses markings to indicate the HEAD (master/main) version of the file and the
fencing (branch_name) version of the file like this:

WORK EXPERIENCE
Leader - Lost Boys
Neverland, 5th Star to Right, Straight on 'Til Morning
Duties:
-Manage Lost Boys
-Consult with Winged Sprites
<<<<<<< HEAD
-Engage in swordfights with professional pirates
=======
-Engage in swordfights with professional pirates such as Smee. 
>>>>>>> fencing
-------------------

VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE


Git basically asks us which version we want to proceed with. 

In the example, we want to proceed with the one added in "fencing" (branch_name)

Delete the content of the line as it appears in the master/main branch

Delete all of Git's special markings including the words HEAD and fencing
(branch_name). If any of Git's markings remain, for example, >>>>>> and ======, 
the conflict remains!

Go on to solve on main/master, git add and commit (and push)
